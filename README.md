# Kalshi Integration Sandbox

Microsoft-style portfolio project for modeling Kalshi trade-intent intake, order lifecycle management, webhook delivery, and operational visibility.

## Architecture

- **Api**: HTTP surface, versioning, Swagger, ProblemDetails, health endpoints
- **Application**: use-case orchestration and service contracts
- **Domain**: core business rules and entities
- **Infrastructure**: persistence, health checks, integrations
- **Contracts**: DTOs and API-facing contracts

Dependency direction follows clean architecture / SOLID principles:
- Domain -> no dependency on outer layers
- Application -> depends on Domain + Contracts
- Infrastructure -> depends on Application + Domain + Contracts
- Api -> depends on Application + Infrastructure + Contracts

## Risk validation

The intake flow now includes configurable risk validation for:
- ticker/side/quantity/price checks
- max order size
- duplicate correlation-id rejection
- explicit risk decision output via `POST /api/v1/risk/validate`

Configuration lives under the `Risk` section in appsettings.

## Persistence

The app now uses **EF Core + SQLite** for local persistence.

The dashboard itself is **real-data only**: no seeded rows are injected into the UI. Test projects override the connection string to isolated temporary SQLite files so automated tests do not pollute the local operator dashboard database.

Tables covered by the current schema:
- `TradeIntents`
- `Orders`
- `OrderEvents`
- `PositionSnapshots`

Local configuration lives in:
- `src/Kalshi.Integration.Api/appsettings.json`
- `src/Kalshi.Integration.Api/appsettings.Development.json`

Note: the environment here does not have `dotnet-ef` installed globally, so schema creation is currently bootstrapped through `Database.EnsureCreated()` at startup rather than checked-in EF migrations.

## Testing

The sandbox now uses three dedicated test projects:
- `tests/Kalshi.Integration.UnitTests`
- `tests/Kalshi.Integration.IntegrationTests`
- `tests/Kalshi.Integration.AcceptanceTests`

See:
- `tests/README.md`

## Event publishing

The sandbox now includes a transport-agnostic application event publisher seam.

Key pieces:
- `IApplicationEventPublisher` in the application boundary
- `ApplicationEventEnvelope` as the neutral event contract
- `InMemoryApplicationEventPublisher` for current in-process publication and tests

Current published events include:
- `trade-intent.created`
- `order.created`
- `execution-update.applied`

This is intentionally **not** a broker integration yet.
The current goal is to demonstrate the seam cleanly without prematurely introducing RabbitMQ or Azure Service Bus.

See:
- `docs/event-publishing.md`

## Health and observability

Health endpoints:
- `/health/live` → process liveness
- `/health/ready` → readiness including SQLite connectivity

Verification steps:

```bash
cd src/Kalshi.Integration.Api
dotnet run

curl -s http://localhost:5000/health/live
curl -s http://localhost:5000/health/ready
```

Expected behavior:
- liveness returns **Healthy** with the `self` check
- readiness returns **Healthy** only when the `database` dependency check succeeds

Observability notes:
- request timing is logged for every HTTP request
- SQLite dependency calls are logged with operation names and durations
- request failure logs include method, path, elapsed time, correlation id, and trace id

## Run

```bash
cd src/Kalshi.Integration.Api
dotnet run
```

Then open:
- `/swagger`
- `/health/live`
- `/health/ready`
- `/api/v1/system/ping`
