# Kalshi Integration Sandbox

A portfolio-grade integration sandbox that models how a production-minded trading workflow can move from API intake through validation, persistence, outbound integration, execution updates, and operator visibility.

The project intentionally mixes:
- **ASP.NET Core / .NET 8** for the core service boundary
- **Node.js** for an external-facing integration gateway / webhook simulator
- **clean architecture + SOLID boundaries** for long-term maintainability
- **EF Core with SQLite or SQL Server / Azure SQL** for practical local and cloud stories
- **Azure-oriented deployment/CI artifacts** for Microsoft-stack credibility

## Repository

- GitHub: https://github.com/jessepetersondev/kalshi-integration-sandbox
- Default branch: `master`
- Visibility: public

This repository is published and accessible for portfolio review.

## Why this project exists

This sandbox is designed to demonstrate the kind of engineering work that sits between product features and real operational systems:
- intake and validation of external requests
- traceable order lifecycle handling
- durable persistence and event history
- external integration forwarding
- production-minded health, auth, logging, and deployment patterns

It is not trying to be a real exchange client. It is trying to be a credible **integration-service example** that is easy to review, run, and discuss.

## What the system does

At a high level, the sandbox supports these flows:
- accept a **trade intent**
- apply **risk validation**
- create and query **orders**
- receive **execution updates** through a Node gateway and apply them to the .NET backend
- persist **order events** and **position snapshots**
- expose an **operator dashboard** and operational endpoints

## Main user flows

### 1) Trade intent intake
A client submits a trade intent to the .NET API.

The request is:
- validated for shape and business rules
- checked against configured risk rules
- persisted when accepted
- rejected with problem-details responses when invalid

### 2) Order creation and lifecycle queries
Accepted trade intents can be converted into orders.

The system then supports:
- creating orders
- retrieving individual orders
- viewing current position snapshots
- tracking order status changes over time

### 3) Execution update ingestion
The Node gateway simulates an external callback/integration layer.

It can:
- accept simulated webhook payloads
- validate payload shape
- forward updates to the .NET API
- surface forwarding failures clearly

The .NET API then:
- applies valid status transitions
- records append-only order events
- updates position snapshots
- preserves retry-safe/idempotent handling behavior

### 4) Operator visibility
The app includes operational endpoints and dashboard support for:
- orders
- positions
- integration/dependency visibility
- health and readiness state

## Project structure explained

### `src/Kalshi.Integration.Api`
Hosts the HTTP API, auth setup, ProblemDetails, Swagger behavior, readiness/liveness endpoints, and operator-facing surface.

### `src/Kalshi.Integration.Application`
Contains the orchestration layer for trade intents, orders, risk evaluation, integration update handling, and application event publishing boundaries.

### `src/Kalshi.Integration.Domain`
Contains the core business model and rules that should remain independent from transport, framework, or storage choices.

### `src/Kalshi.Integration.Infrastructure`
Implements persistence, outbound integration behavior, health checks, migration support, and broker/integration adapters.

### `src/Kalshi.Integration.Contracts`
Contains the DTOs and request/response contracts shared across the service boundary.

### `tests/*`
The repo uses dedicated test projects by type:
- unit tests for fast domain/application coverage
- integration tests for API + persistence behavior
- acceptance tests for the main end-to-end demo path

### `node-gateway/`
Represents the external/customer-facing integration seam and makes webhook-style execution updates testable without a real external system.

## Local setup

### Prerequisites
- .NET SDK 8
- Node.js 22
- Docker (optional, for containerized local runs)

### Quick start

#### API
```bash
cd src/Kalshi.Integration.Api
dotnet run
```

#### Node gateway
```bash
cd node-gateway
node src/server.js
```

The default local story uses SQLite.

If you want SQL Server / Azure SQL instead, configure:
- `Database__Provider=SqlServer` or `Database__Provider=AzureSql`
- `ConnectionStrings__KalshiIntegration`

See:
- `docs/database-providers.md`
- `docs/environment-configuration.md`

## Containerized local run

From the repo root:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Published endpoints:
- API: `http://localhost:5000`
- Gateway: `http://localhost:3001`

Stop the stack:

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Authentication and authorization

The API now uses **JWT bearer authentication** with **policy-based authorization** instead of ad hoc endpoint checks.

Current policy intent:
- `trading.write` → write access for `admin` or `trader`
- `trading.read` → read access for `admin`, `trader`, or `operator`
- `operations.read` → operational/dashboard access for `admin` or `operator`
- `integration.write` → inbound integration/update access for `admin` or `integration`

Public endpoints remain intentionally anonymous:
- `/`
- `/dashboard` and static dashboard assets
- `/health/live`
- `/health/ready`
- `/api/v1/system/ping`
- `/api/v1/auth/dev-token` when development-token issuance is enabled

Protected examples:
- `POST /api/v1/trade-intents`
- `POST /api/v1/orders`
- `GET /api/v1/orders/{id}`
- `GET /api/v1/positions`
- `GET /api/v1/dashboard/*`
- `POST /api/v1/integrations/execution-updates`
- `GET /api/v1/system/dependencies/node-gateway`

### Local token workflow

For local work, the app can issue a development JWT so you can exercise protected endpoints without wiring a real identity provider first.

Issue a token locally:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/v1/auth/dev-token \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"roles":["admin","operator","trader","integration"],"subject":"local-dev-user"}'
```

Use the returned access token:

```bash
TOKEN="<paste access token>"

curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/v1/dashboard/orders \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

## Health and observability

Health endpoints:
- `/health/live` → process liveness
- `/health/ready` → readiness including configured dependencies

Current observability includes:
- structured request timing logs
- database/dependency call logging
- correlation-id and trace-id flow
- provider-aware dependency naming in logs

See also:
- `docs/environment-configuration.md`
- `docs/deployment-artifacts.md`
- `docs/azure-deployment-guide.md`

## Event publishing

The sandbox includes a transport-agnostic application event publishing seam with:
- `IApplicationEventPublisher`
- `InMemoryApplicationEventPublisher`
- `RabbitMqApplicationEventPublisher`

Current published events include:
- `trade-intent.created`
- `order.created`
- `execution-update.applied`

See:
- `docs/event-publishing.md`

## Testing

The repo uses three dedicated test projects:
- `tests/Kalshi.Integration.UnitTests`
- `tests/Kalshi.Integration.IntegrationTests`
- `tests/Kalshi.Integration.AcceptanceTests`

Local verification commands:

```bash
dotnet format KalshiIntegrationSandbox.sln --verify-no-changes
dotnet build KalshiIntegrationSandbox.sln
dotnet test KalshiIntegrationSandbox.sln
```

Node gateway tests:

```bash
cd node-gateway
node --test
```

See:
- `tests/README.md`

## Azure DevOps CI

The repo includes an Azure DevOps pipeline at `azure-pipelines.yml`.

The pipeline currently:
- restores the .NET solution
- verifies formatting with `dotnet format --verify-no-changes`
- builds the solution
- runs .NET tests
- runs Node gateway tests
- publishes .NET test results
- publishes Cobertura unit-test coverage artifacts

## Deployment and cloud readiness

The repo now includes:
- environment configuration guidance for local/dev/cloud
- Dockerfiles for API and gateway
- local multi-service `docker-compose.yml`
- Azure Container Apps deployment guidance

See:
- `docs/environment-configuration.md`
- `docs/deployment-artifacts.md`
- `docs/azure-deployment-guide.md`

## Notes for reviewers

If you are reviewing this as a portfolio project, the important signals are:
- clear service boundaries instead of framework-driven sprawl
- production-minded validation, auth, persistence, and health design
- realistic integration seams through the Node gateway
- test coverage across unit, integration, and acceptance layers
- credible Microsoft-stack deployment and CI stories without overcomplicating the repo
